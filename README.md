Real Estate Price Prediction<br>
This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning algorithms, focusing on model accuracy and selection through advanced evaluation techniques.<br><br>

Project Overview<br>
Data Cleaning and Exploration: Initial data exploration and preprocessing steps, including removing irrelevant features and handling missing values.<br>
Model Evaluation with K-Fold Cross-Validation: Used K-Fold cross-validation to assess the accuracy of the Linear Regression model, ensuring consistency in model performance.<br>
Model Selection with GridSearchCV: Compared Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree models using GridSearchCV to identify the best-performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters.<br><br>
Results<br>
The optimal model was selected based on cross-validation accuracy and refined using GridSearchCV, achieving robust performance in predicting house prices.<br><br>

This project is a great resource for those interested in predictive modeling, data preprocessing, and advanced model selection techniques in real estate!<br>
